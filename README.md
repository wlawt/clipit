  # ClipIt â€” Snipping Tool for Videos ðŸ“Ž
</div>

## ClipIt 

Largely inspired by frustrations in my academic workflows, I wanted a way to 
easily share explanations/concepts with my friends, just like how I use 
Snipping Tool. 

ClipIt is built ontop of this idea with the goal of making it easy to share
videos clips with others.

## Run locally

### Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd clipit
npm install
```

### Start servers

```
python clip.py  // In root
cd clipit 
yarn dev
```
